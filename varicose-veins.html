          <h3>Varicose Veins</h3>
          <img class="hernia-repair" src="images/varicose-veins.jpg" alt="Varicose Veins">
          <p>Varicose veins are a sign of venous insufficiency, where the return of venous biood from the legs to the heart is impeded. This can cause aching, heaviness, burning, and cramping in the early stages of the disease. Over time venous insufficiency can lead to leg swelling, darkening of the skin near the ankles and shins, bleeding, and finally an open sore near the ankle bones, known as a venous ulcer.</p>
          <p>A classification of venous disease was established in 1994. It is called CEAP, and the initials stand for clinical state, etiology, anatomy, and pathophysiology. The six classes are:</p>
          <h4>C1</h4>
          <p>Elangiectasias or reticular veins(thin, tortuous, purplish red veins often found on the outside of the thighs)</p>
          <h4>C2</h4>
          <p>Varicose veins(4mm or larger diameter veins that are tortuous)</p>
          <h4>C3</h4>
          <p>Edema(swelling)</p>
          <h4>C4a</h4>
          <p>Pigmentation(brownish discoloration of the skin on the loiwer legs) and eczema</p>
          <h4>C4b</h4>
          <p>Ipodermatosclerosis and atrophy blanche(thickening of the underlying fat tissue with overlying thickening and whitening of the skin)</p>
          <h4>C5</h4>
          <p>Healed venous ulcer</p>
          <h4>C6</h4>
          <p>active venous ulcer CEAP classification is an aid to diagnosis and a guide for treatment.</p>
          <h3>Endovenous Closure</h3>
          <p>Endovenous Closure is an exciting alternative to varicose vein stripping. Stripping works but it requires general anesthesia, many incisions, more pain, and a longer recovery. In contrast, endovenous closure uses a catheter that is powered by radiofrequency or laser. It can be done in the office using "local1 anesthesia (injections of numbing agents like lidocaine, novacaine, etc.) with no incisions, little to no pain, and a return to normal activities the day of the procedure.</p>
          <p>Typically, the long and short saphenous veins and their branches are the veins that are appropriate for this procedure. A duplex exam (ultrasound) is done before the procedure to identify the abnormal vein or veins. On the day of the procedure the vein is marked on the leg by using the duplex ultrasound, and then, the leg is prepped (washed with an antibacterial soap ) and covered with sterile drapes. The doctor will then numb the skin over the vein near the knee, and start an i.v. in the vein. The endovenous catheter is inserted through the i.v. into the vein, and using the duplex ultrasound the catheter is maneuvered up the vein to it's starting position. Next the doctor will numb two or three other spots over the course of the vein to be closed. Through each of these spots, he will inject a saline solution around the vein to compress and cool it. At this point the vein can be closed. When the catheter is turned on it's tip heats up. This heat causes the vein to lose it's integrity and collapse in on itself, thus "closing" the lumen of the vein. When the long or short saphenous vein is closed, it's branches can be eliminated by mini-phlebectomy (small incisions to remove the veins) or sclerotherapy (a series of injections of a sclerosing solutions into the varicose branches that will close the lumen of these veins).</p>
          <p>When the procedure is completed a dressing and compression stocking will be placed on the leg, and this is worn for at least ten days. The stocking maybe taken off at bedtime, and then, repositioned on the leg in the morning. Normal activities can be resumed the day of surgery, with the exception of heavy lifting, and most patients will require no pain medication.</p>
